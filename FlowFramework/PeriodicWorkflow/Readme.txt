You can FlowFramework example at https://github.com/aws/aws-swf-flow-library/tree/master/src/samples/AwsFlowFramework/src/com/amazonaws/services/simpleworkflow/flow/examples/periodicworkflow

I do not fully understand the objective of this example. However the closest example in Guflow is "PeriodicWorkflow", in RecurrentScheduling example. This workflow
schedules an activity every 1 one. You pretty much customize the time logic according to your need.
