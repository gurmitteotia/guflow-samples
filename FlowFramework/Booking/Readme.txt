You can access the FlowFramework example at link- https://github.com/aws/aws-swf-flow-library/tree/master/src/samples/AwsFlowFramework/src/com/amazonaws/services/simpleworkflow/flow/examples/booking

I suggest you to look at Booking example in Guflow. Guflow example is dealing with many more activities than Flow Framework's example.
