You can find FlowFramework example at https://github.com/aws/aws-swf-flow-library/tree/master/src/samples/AwsFlowFramework/src/com/amazonaws/services/simpleworkflow/flow/examples/cron.

I don't fully understand the objective of this sample. In guflow please look at RecrurentScheduling example, which I believe touch upon similar concepts.
